The CDC73 gene provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found throughout the body and is likely involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin is also thought to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), either promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation depending on signals within the cell.  CDC73 gene mutations cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome by reducing the amount of functional parafibromin that is produced. Most of these mutations result in a parafibromin protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. Without functional parafibromin, cell proliferation is not properly regulated. Uncontrolled cell division can lead to the formation of tumors. It is unknown why only certain tissues seem to be affected by changes in parafibromin.  Some people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome do not have identified mutations in the CDC73 gene. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.\",\n          \"Scientists continue to look at new ways to prevent, treat, and diagnose prostate cancer. Research has already led to a number of advances in these areas. Dietary Research Several studies are under way to explore the causes of prostate cancer. Some researchers think that diet may affect a man's chances of developing prostate cancer. For example, some studies show that prostate cancer is more common in populations that consume a high-fat diet, particularly animal fat, and in populations with diets that lack certain nutrients. Research on Testosterone Some research suggests that high levels of testosterone may increase a man's risk of prostate cancer. The difference in prostate cancer risk among racial groups could be related to high testosterone levels, but it also could result from diet or other lifestyle factors. Genetic Research Researchers are studying changes in genes that may increase the risk for developing prostate cancer. Some studies are looking at the genes of men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age, such as less than 55 years old, and the genes of families who have several members with the disease. Other studies are trying to identify which genes, or arrangements of genes, are most likely to lead to prostate cancer. Much more work is needed, however, before scientists can say exactly how genetic changes relate to prostate cancer. Prevention Research Several studies have explored ways to prevent prostate cancer. In October 2008, initial results of a study on the use of the dietary supplements vitamin E and selenium found that they did not provide any benefit in reducing the number of new cases of the disease. A few studies suggest that a diet that regularly includes tomato-based foods may help protect men from prostate cancer, but there are no studies that conclusively prove this hypothesis. According to results of a study that was re-analyzed in 2013, men who took finasteride, a drug that affects male hormone levels, reduced their chances of getting prostate cancer by nearly 30 percent compared to men who took a placebo. Unlike earlier findings from this study, this new analysis showed no increased risk of late stage disease due to use of finasteride. Stopping Prostate Cancer from Returning Scientists are also looking at ways to stop prostate cancer from returning in men who have already been treated for the disease. These approaches use drugs such as finasteride, flutamide, nilutamide, and LH-RH agonists that manipulate hormone levels. In 2010, the FDA approved a therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge, for use in some men with metastatic prostate cancer. Provenge may provide a 4-month improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. Other similar vaccine therapies are in development. Research on New Blood Tests Some researchers are working to develop new blood tests to detect the antibodies that the immune system produces to fight prostate cancer. When used along with PSA testing, the antibody tests may provide more accurate results about whether or not a man has prostate cancer. Researching New Approaches to Treatment Through research, doctors are trying to find new, more effective ways to treat prostate cancer. Cryosurgery -- destroying cancer by freezing it -- is under study as an alternative to surgery and radiation therapy. To avoid damaging healthy tissue, the doctor places an instrument known as a cryoprobe in direct contact with the tumor to freeze it. Doctors are studying new ways of using radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, too. Studies have shown that hormonal therapy given after radiation therapy can help certain men whose cancer has spread to nearby tissues. Scientists are also testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and biological therapy for men whose cancer does not respond, or stops responding, to hormonal therapy. They are also exploring new ways to schedule and combine various treatments. For example, they are studying hormonal therapy to find out if using it to shrink the tumor before a man has surgery or radiation might be a useful approach. For men with early stage prostate cancer, researchers are also comparing treatment with watchful waiting. The results of this work will help doctors know whether to treat early stage prostate cancer immediately or only later on, if symptoms occur or worsen.\",\n          \"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

This type of neuropathy is more common in those with type 2 diabetes and in older adults with diabetes. Proximal neuropathy causes weakness in the legs and the inability to go from a sitting to a standing position without help. Treatment for weakness or pain is usually needed. The length of the recovery period varies, depending on the type of nerve damage.\",\n          \"Doctors diagnose neuropathy on the basis of symptoms and a physical exam. During the exam, the doctor may check blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensitivity to position changes, vibration, temperature, or light touch.\\n                \\nFoot Exams\\n                \\nExperts recommend that people with diabetes have a comprehensive foot exam each year to check for peripheral neuropathy. People diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy need more frequent foot exams. A comprehensive foot exam assesses the skin, muscles, bones, circulation, and sensation of the feet. The doctor may assess protective sensation or feeling in the feet by touching them with a nylon monofilamentsimilar to a bristle on a hairbrushattached to a wand or by pricking them with a pin. People who cannot sense pressure from a pinprick or monofilament have lost protective sensation and are at risk for developing foot sores that may not heal properly. The doctor may also check temperature perception or use a tuning fork, which is more sensitive than touch pressure, to assess vibration perception.\\n                \\nOther Tests\\n                \\nThe doctor may perform other tests as part of the diagnosis.\\n                \\n- Nerve conduction studies or electromyography are sometimes used to help determine the type and extent of nerve damage. Nerve conduction studies check the transmission of electrical current through a nerve. Electromyography shows how well muscles respond to electrical signals transmitted by nearby nerves. These tests are rarely needed to diagnose neuropathy.  - A check of heart rate variability shows how the heart responds to deep breathing and to changes in blood pressure and posture.  - Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of internal organs. An ultrasound of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, for example, can be used to assess the structure of these organs and show whether the bladder empties completely after urination.\",\n          \"Focal neuropathy appears suddenly and affects specific nerves, most often in the head, torso, or leg. Focal neuropathy may cause\\n                \\n- inability to focus the eye  - double vision  - aching behind one eye  - paralysis on one side of the face, called Bell's palsy  - severe pain in the lower back or pelvis  - pain in the front of a thigh  - pain in the chest, stomach, or side  - pain on the outside of the shin or inside of the foot  - chest or abdominal pain that is sometimes mistaken for heart disease, a heart attack, or appendicitis\\n                \\nFocal neuropathy is painful and unpredictable and occurs most often in older adults with diabetes. However, it tends to improve by itself over weeks or months and does not cause long-term damage.\\n                \\nPeople with diabetes also tend to develop nerve compressions, also called entrapment syndromes. One of the most common is carpal tunnel syndrome, which causes numbness and tingling of the hand and sometimes muscle weakness or pain. Other nerves susceptible to entrapment may cause pain on the outside of the shin or the inside of the foot.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The CDC73 gene provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found throughout the body and is likely involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin is also thought to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), either promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation depending on signals within the cell.  CDC73 gene mutations cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome by reducing the amount of functional parafibromin that is produced. Most of these mutations result in a parafibromin protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. Without functional parafibromin, cell proliferation is not properly regulated. Uncontrolled cell division can lead to the formation of tumors. It is unknown why only certain tissues seem to be affected by changes in parafibromin.  Some people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome do not have identified mutations in the CDC73 gene. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.\",\n          \"Scientists continue to look at new ways to prevent, treat, and diagnose prostate cancer. Research has already led to a number of advances in these areas. Dietary Research Several studies are under way to explore the causes of prostate cancer. Some researchers think that diet may affect a man's chances of developing prostate cancer. For example, some studies show that prostate cancer is more common in populations that consume a high-fat diet, particularly animal fat, and in populations with diets that lack certain nutrients. Research on Testosterone Some research suggests that high levels of testosterone may increase a man's risk of prostate cancer. The difference in prostate cancer risk among racial groups could be related to high testosterone levels, but it also could result from diet or other lifestyle factors. Genetic Research Researchers are studying changes in genes that may increase the risk for developing prostate cancer. Some studies are looking at the genes of men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age, such as less than 55 years old, and the genes of families who have several members with the disease. Other studies are trying to identify which genes, or arrangements of genes, are most likely to lead to prostate cancer. Much more work is needed, however, before scientists can say exactly how genetic changes relate to prostate cancer. Prevention Research Several studies have explored ways to prevent prostate cancer. In October 2008, initial results of a study on the use of the dietary supplements vitamin E and selenium found that they did not provide any benefit in reducing the number of new cases of the disease. A few studies suggest that a diet that regularly includes tomato-based foods may help protect men from prostate cancer, but there are no studies that conclusively prove this hypothesis. According to results of a study that was re-analyzed in 2013, men who took finasteride, a drug that affects male hormone levels, reduced their chances of getting prostate cancer by nearly 30 percent compared to men who took a placebo. Unlike earlier findings from this study, this new analysis showed no increased risk of late stage disease due to use of finasteride. Stopping Prostate Cancer from Returning Scientists are also looking at ways to stop prostate cancer from returning in men who have already been treated for the disease. These approaches use drugs such as finasteride, flutamide, nilutamide, and LH-RH agonists that manipulate hormone levels. In 2010, the FDA approved a therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge, for use in some men with metastatic prostate cancer. Provenge may provide a 4-month improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. Other similar vaccine therapies are in development. Research on New Blood Tests Some researchers are working to develop new blood tests to detect the antibodies that the immune system produces to fight prostate cancer. When used along with PSA testing, the antibody tests may provide more accurate results about whether or not a man has prostate cancer. Researching New Approaches to Treatment Through research, doctors are trying to find new, more effective ways to treat prostate cancer. Cryosurgery -- destroying cancer by freezing it -- is under study as an alternative to surgery and radiation therapy. To avoid damaging healthy tissue, the doctor places an instrument known as a cryoprobe in direct contact with the tumor to freeze it. Doctors are studying new ways of using radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, too. Studies have shown that hormonal therapy given after radiation therapy can help certain men whose cancer has spread to nearby tissues. Scientists are also testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and biological therapy for men whose cancer does not respond, or stops responding, to hormonal therapy. They are also exploring new ways to schedule and combine various treatments. For example, they are studying hormonal therapy to find out if using it to shrink the tumor before a man has surgery or radiation might be a useful approach. For men with early stage prostate cancer, researchers are also comparing treatment with watchful waiting. The results of this work will help doctors know whether to treat early stage prostate cancer immediately or only later on, if symptoms occur or worsen.\",\n          \"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

If RTA is the reason, additional information about the sodium, potassium, and chloride levels in the urine and the potassium level in the blood will help identify which type of RTA a person has. In all cases, the first goal of therapy is to neutralize acid in the blood, but different treatments may be needed to address the different underlying causes of acidosis.\",\n          \"Blood Pressure Medicines\\n                \\nScientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. Drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. Two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretic can also be useful. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed.\\n                \\nAn example of an effective ACE inhibitor is lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes. The benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure: it may directly protect the kidneys' glomeruli. ACE inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure.\\n                \\nAn example of an effective ARB is losartan (Cozaar), which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events.\\n                \\nPatients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines.\\n                \\nModerate-protein Diets\\n                \\nIn people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. Experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein, but avoid high-protein diets. For people with greatly reduced kidney function, a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure. Anyone following a reduced-protein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition.\\n                \\nIntensive Management of Blood Glucose\\n                \\nAntihypertensive drugs and low-protein diets can slow CKD. A third treatment, known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control, has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of CKD.\\n                \\nThe human body normally converts food to glucose, the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body's cells. To enter cells, glucose needs the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When a person does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present, the body cannot process glucose, and it builds up in the bloodstream. High levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes.\\n                \\nIntensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal. The regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently, administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity, following a diet and activity plan, and consulting a health care team regularly. Some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day.\\n                \\nA number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels. The intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliterabout 80 milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, conducted from 1976 to 1997, showed conclusively that, in people with improved blood glucose control, the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third. Additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of CKD.\",\n          \"The two kidneys are bean-shaped organs located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Everyday, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid.\\n                \\nBlood enters the kidneys through arteries that branch inside the kidneys into tiny clusters of looping blood vessels. Each cluster is called a glomerulus, which comes from the Greek word meaning filter. The plural form of the word is glomeruli. There are approximately 1 million glomeruli, or filters, in each kidney. The glomerulus is attached to the opening of a small fluid-collecting tube called a tubule. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus, and extra fluid and wastes pass into the tubule and become urine. Eventually, the urine drains from the kidneys into the bladder through larger tubes called ureters.\\n                \\nEach glomerulus-and-tubule unit is called a nephron. Each kidney is composed of about 1 million nephrons. In healthy nephrons, the glomerular membrane that separates the blood vessel from the tubule allows waste products and extra water to pass into the tubule while keeping blood cells and protein in the bloodstream.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The CDC73 gene provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found throughout the body and is likely involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin is also thought to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), either promoting or inhibiting cell proliferation depending on signals within the cell.  CDC73 gene mutations cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome by reducing the amount of functional parafibromin that is produced. Most of these mutations result in a parafibromin protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. Without functional parafibromin, cell proliferation is not properly regulated. Uncontrolled cell division can lead to the formation of tumors. It is unknown why only certain tissues seem to be affected by changes in parafibromin.  Some people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome do not have identified mutations in the CDC73 gene. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.\",\n          \"Scientists continue to look at new ways to prevent, treat, and diagnose prostate cancer. Research has already led to a number of advances in these areas. Dietary Research Several studies are under way to explore the causes of prostate cancer. Some researchers think that diet may affect a man's chances of developing prostate cancer. For example, some studies show that prostate cancer is more common in populations that consume a high-fat diet, particularly animal fat, and in populations with diets that lack certain nutrients. Research on Testosterone Some research suggests that high levels of testosterone may increase a man's risk of prostate cancer. The difference in prostate cancer risk among racial groups could be related to high testosterone levels, but it also could result from diet or other lifestyle factors. Genetic Research Researchers are studying changes in genes that may increase the risk for developing prostate cancer. Some studies are looking at the genes of men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively young age, such as less than 55 years old, and the genes of families who have several members with the disease. Other studies are trying to identify which genes, or arrangements of genes, are most likely to lead to prostate cancer. Much more work is needed, however, before scientists can say exactly how genetic changes relate to prostate cancer. Prevention Research Several studies have explored ways to prevent prostate cancer. In October 2008, initial results of a study on the use of the dietary supplements vitamin E and selenium found that they did not provide any benefit in reducing the number of new cases of the disease. A few studies suggest that a diet that regularly includes tomato-based foods may help protect men from prostate cancer, but there are no studies that conclusively prove this hypothesis. According to results of a study that was re-analyzed in 2013, men who took finasteride, a drug that affects male hormone levels, reduced their chances of getting prostate cancer by nearly 30 percent compared to men who took a placebo. Unlike earlier findings from this study, this new analysis showed no increased risk of late stage disease due to use of finasteride. Stopping Prostate Cancer from Returning Scientists are also looking at ways to stop prostate cancer from returning in men who have already been treated for the disease. These approaches use drugs such as finasteride, flutamide, nilutamide, and LH-RH agonists that manipulate hormone levels. In 2010, the FDA approved a therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge, for use in some men with metastatic prostate cancer. Provenge may provide a 4-month improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. Other similar vaccine therapies are in development. Research on New Blood Tests Some researchers are working to develop new blood tests to detect the antibodies that the immune system produces to fight prostate cancer. When used along with PSA testing, the antibody tests may provide more accurate results about whether or not a man has prostate cancer. Researching New Approaches to Treatment Through research, doctors are trying to find new, more effective ways to treat prostate cancer. Cryosurgery -- destroying cancer by freezing it -- is under study as an alternative to surgery and radiation therapy. To avoid damaging healthy tissue, the doctor places an instrument known as a cryoprobe in direct contact with the tumor to freeze it. Doctors are studying new ways of using radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, too. Studies have shown that hormonal therapy given after radiation therapy can help certain men whose cancer has spread to nearby tissues. Scientists are also testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and biological therapy for men whose cancer does not respond, or stops responding, to hormonal therapy. They are also exploring new ways to schedule and combine various treatments. For example, they are studying hormonal therapy to find out if using it to shrink the tumor before a man has surgery or radiation might be a useful approach. For men with early stage prostate cancer, researchers are also comparing treatment with watchful waiting. The results of this work will help doctors know whether to treat early stage prostate cancer immediately or only later on, if symptoms occur or worsen.\",\n          \"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.

However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here.  Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. Over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes.

Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on either side of the windpipe. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. The glands of the endocrine system produce, store, and release hormones into the bloodstream. The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the bodys cells.\\n                \\nThe thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 is the active hormone and is made from T4. Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels.\\n                \\nThyroid hormone production is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more TSH. When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by decreasing TSH production.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Treatment of hemiplegic migraine varies depending on severity and which symptoms are most problematic for the patient. In general, treatments aim to manage symptoms. Drugs that are effective in the prevention of common migraines may be used in hemiplegic migraine. Prophylactic management is applied to patients with frequent, long lasting, or severe attacks. Examples of migraine drugs that have been tried with variable success in people with hemiplegic migraine, include oral verapamil, acetazolamide, lamotrigine. There are a few articles describing the use of nasal administration of ketamine, intravenous verapamil, and triptans for treatment of aura in people with hemiplegic migraine. Use of triptans in hemiplegic migraine is controversial and may be contraindicated in people with severe attacks. For further information on these and other treatments, we recommend that you speak with your healthcare provider.\",\n          \"This condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell may or may not cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases of X-linked inheritance, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\",\n          \"A healthy diet is important in all stages of cirrhosis because malnutrition is common in people with this disease.

            "Response: too much glucose in the blood diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. it stays in your blood instead. your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. however, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. with this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. to survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. learn more about type 1 diabetes here. type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. as a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. at first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. learn more about type 2 diabetes here. gestational diabetes some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. prediabetes prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. learn more about prediabetes here. signs of diabetes many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. some lose weight without trying. additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. how many have diabetes? nearly 29 million americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). about 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. people can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. in 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the u.s -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. see more statistics about diabetes from the national diabetes statistics report 2014. (centers for disease control and prevention.) if diabetes is not managed diabetes is a very serious disease. over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. if you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. people with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others. the best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and to avoid smoking. it is not always easy, but people who make an ongoing effort to manage their diabetes can greatly improve their overall health. diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. it stays in your blood instead. your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. however, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. with this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. to survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. learn more about type 1 diabetes here. learn more about type 1 diabetes here. type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. as a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. at first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. learn more about type 2 diabetes here. prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. in 2012, about 86 million people in the u.s. had prediabetes, and 51% of those 65 or older had prediabetes. people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. learn more about prediabetes here. studies have shown that most people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within a few years, unless they change their lifestyle. most people with prediabetes dont have any symptoms. your doctor can test your blood to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. losing weightat least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weightcan prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. thats 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. you can lose weight by cutting the amount of calories and fat you consume and by being physically active at least 30 to 60 minutes every day. physical activity also helps your body use the hormone insulin properly. your body needs insulin to use glucose for energy. medicine can help control the amount of glucose in your blood. ask your doctor if medicine to control glucose is right for you. learn more about prediabetes here. heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death for people with diabetes. controlling the abcs of diabetes -- your blood glucose, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol, as well as stopping smoking -- can help prevent these and other complications from diabetes. -

(tip: you dont need to get your exercise in all at one time.) for more information on exercise and older adults, see exercises to try or visit go4life, the exercise and physical activity campaign from the national institute on aging. always talk with a doctor before starting a new physical activity program. diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. glucose comes from the foods you eat. insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. with type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. with type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. you can also have prediabetes. this means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. it can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes. blood tests can show if you have diabetes. one type of test, the a1c, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. you should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed. nih: national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases.\n",

            "User: How is hypertension treated?\n",
            "Response: pulmonary hypertension (ph) is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. it is a serious condition. if you have it, the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. over time, your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. symptoms of ph include - shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs - tiredness - chest pain - a racing heartbeat - pain on the upper right side of the abdomen - decreased appetite as ph worsens, you may find it hard to do any physical activities. there are two main kinds of ph. one runs in families or appears for no known reason. the other kind is related to another condition, usually heart or lung disease. there is no cure for ph. treatments can control symptoms. they involve treating the heart or lung disease, medicines, oxygen, and sometimes lung transplantation. nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute. pulmonary hypertension (pull-mun-ary hi-per-ten-shun), or ph, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. these arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. ph causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. as the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity. overview to understand ph, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. each side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. the lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (ven-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. the blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. the upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (ay-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. the blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. from the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta. for more information about the heart and lungs, go to the diseases and conditions index how the heart works and how the lungs work articles. ph begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause ph. for example, the condition may develop if: the walls of the arteries tighten. the walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. blood clots form in the arteries. these changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. as a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak. your heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. this causes heart failure. heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have ph. ph is divided into five groups based on its causes. in all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmhg at rest or 30 mmhg during physical activity. the pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 820 mmhg at rest. (the mmhg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) other diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause ph. some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for ph on to them). in some cases, the cause isn't known. outlook ph has no cure. however, research for new treatments is ongoing. the earlier ph is treated, the easier it is to control. treatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. these treatments can relieve ph symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms.\n",

            "User: Can you explain asthma triggers?\n",
            "Response: asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. if you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. that makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. when your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air. symptoms of asthma include - wheezing - coughing, especially early in the morning or at night - chest tightness - shortness of breath not all people who have asthma have these symptoms. having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. you may also have allergy tests. when your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma attack. severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. nih: national heart, lung, and blood institute. asthma is a breathing disorder that affects the airways. people with this condition experience recurrent swelling and narrowing of the airways of the lungs which is associated with wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. most affected people have episodes of symptoms (\"asthma attacks\") followed by symptom-free periods; however, some may experience persistent shortness of breath in between attacks. asthma is considered a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely due to a combination of multiple genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever or eczema. having a family member with asthma is associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. treatment generally includes various medications, both to prevent asthma attacks and to provide quick relief during an attack. espaol asthma (az-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. the coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. in the united states, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. about 7million of these people are children. overview to understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. the airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. people who have asthma have inflamed airways. the inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. the airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances. when the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. this narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. the swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. this chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed. asthma sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. other times, symptoms continue to get worse. when symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-ba-shuns). treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. this will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. outlook asthma has no cure. even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. however, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. they have few, if any, symptoms. they can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. if you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. for successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers.\n",

            "Response: glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. the most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. with early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. (watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) see this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more. see a glossary of glaucoma terms. the optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers. it connects the retina to the brain. open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. in the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. when the fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. if the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. national eye institute national institutes of health 2020 vision place bethesda, md 20892-3655 301-496-5248 e-mail: 2020@nei.nih.gov www.nei.nih.gov the glaucoma foundation 80 maiden lane, suite 700 new york, ny 10038 212-285-0080 glaucoma research foundation 251 post street, suite 600 san francisco, ca 94108 1-800-826-6693. glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. it is a leading cause of blindness in the united states. it usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. often there are no symptoms at first. without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. they seem to be looking through a tunnel. over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. a comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. people at risk should get eye exams at least every two years. they include - african americans over age 40 - people over age 60, especially mexican americans - people with a family history of glaucoma there is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery. nih: national eye institute.\n",
